# Terraform Practice Repository

Welcome to my Terraform Practice Repository! This repository contains various Terraform projects that I have created while preparing for the Terraform certification. All the projects here are open-source and free to use.

## Overview

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files. This repository showcases my practical experience with Terraform and covers a range of scenarios for deploying and managing cloud resources.

Each project is contained within its own directory, and you can find the respective `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf` and other files inside each project folder.

## Usage

Feel free to delve into these projects, using them as references or starting points for your own Terraform deployments. Before running any of the projects, make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can also configure backends to store your state files remotely, promoting better collaboration and version control.
